# Surface Adsorption Energy and Sensitivity Prediction of gas-TM/PC systems

## Overview
This repository focuses on predicting gas adsorption energy and sensitivity on TM/PC surfaces using DFT-driven and deep learning approaches.  
Accurate prediction of adsorption properties is critical for understanding **surface reactions, catalysis, gas sensing, and materials design**.

The project aims to provide an efficient and scalable framework for modeling the relationship between **TM/PC surface structures, adsorbate properties, and adsorption behavior**.
