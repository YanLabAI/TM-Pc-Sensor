# Metal Surface Adsorption Energy and Sensitivity Prediction

## Overview
This repository focuses on predicting adsorption energy and sensitivity on metal surfaces using data-driven and deep learning approaches.  
Accurate prediction of adsorption properties is critical for understanding **surface reactions, catalysis, gas sensing, and materials design**.

The project aims to provide an efficient and scalable framework for modeling the relationship between **metal surface structures, adsorbate properties, and adsorption behavior**.
